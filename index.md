## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

`2019-present`
*Research Assistant*, Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Laboratory (DISCL), TTU, Lubbock, Texas
- Research and Publication: Conducted innovative research in High-Performance Computing, Computer Architecture, and Parallel and Distributed Computing. Authored and published research papers in reputable academic conferences and journals.
- Professional Development and Networking: Actively engaged in the academic community by attending conferences, workshops, and seminars. Presented research papers and posters at these events.
- Mentorship and Education: Mentored both graduate and undergraduate students in their independent research studies. Provided guidance on research topics, project development, and data analysis.
- Software Development and Collaboration: Played an integral role in developing and maintaining research software and tools. Wrote, tested, and documented code for various projects. Contributed to open-source software initiatives, fostering collaborative innovation.
- Server Administration: Managed two high-end servers (Hugo and Alita) hosted at the High-Performance Computing Center. Oversaw server configuration, maintenance, and software management. Ensured consistent server availability and reliability while troubleshooting issues as they arose.

`2021, 2022, 2023 [Summer]`
*Graduate Student Intern*, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, California
- Data Integration and Analysis: Integrated HPC monitoring data from diverse sources (LDMS, DCGM, Slurm, VictoriaMetrics) for comprehensive analysis of system-wide architectural efficiency, including CPU, GPU, DRAM, and HBM2 resource utilization. Identified critical trends and patterns within the data to drive insights into system performance, with a focus on NERSC's Cori and Perlmutter.
- Machine Learning Expertise: Conducted in-depth statistical analysis of job-level monitoring data. Applied a variety of machine learning models, including SVC, LinearSVC, Decision Tree, and Random Forests, to analyze jobs based on time-series features.
- Innovative Data Processing: Pioneered a novel approach by encoding time-series monitoring data as images. Achieved high accuracy through the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify and predict job applications.
- Simulation and System Design: Designed and implemented a discrete event simulator to study resource management and job scheduling in HPC systems, with a specific focus on systems with disaggregated memory resources.


`2018-2019`
*Graduate Student Programmer*, Teaching, Learning and Professional Development Center (TLPDC),TTU, Lubbock, Texas
- Website Maintenance and Communication: Maintained and updated TLPDC web pages, ensuring a fresh and relevant online presence. Facilitated communication with software application providers to meet product requirements efficiently. 
- Database Management and Security: Managed the MySQL database with precision, safeguarding valuable data assets. Implemented robust backup strategies to protect against data loss. Proactively addressed and resolved database access issues to maintain uninterrupted operations.
